 * \class HigherOrderAccurateDerivativeOperator
 * \brief A NeighborhoodOperator for calculating an n-th order accurate derivative
 * at a pixel.
 *
 * \brief Calculate the image derivative from a higher order accurate
 * central-difference derivative kernel.
 *
 * Based on the work here:
 *
 * Khan, IR and Ohba, Ryoji.  "Closed-form expressions for the finite difference
 * approximations of first and higher derivatives based on Taylor series."
 * Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics.  vol 107.  p. 179-193.
 * 1999.

 * Khan, IR and Ohba, Ryoji.  "Taylor series based finite difference
 * approximations of higher-degree derivatives."  Journal of Computational and
 * Applied Mathematics.  vol 154.  p. 115-124.  2003.
 *
 * To specify the order of accuracy, use SetOrderOfAccuracy().  The
 * approximation will be accurate to two times the OrderOfAccuracy in terms of
 * Taylor series terms.
 *
 * @todo: implement support for higher order derivatives.
